# This file specifies k^2 trees that are used in the benchmark.
#
# Each index is specified by a triple: K2_ID;SDSL_TYPE;K2_LATEX_NAME
# * K2_ID        : An identifier for the index. Only letters and underscores are allowed in ID.
# * SDSL_TYPE    : Corresponding sdsl type.
# * K2_LATEX_NAME: LaTeX name for output in the benchmark report. No underscores are allowed here.

# Different k and Bit-Vectors:
K2_BV;k2_tree_comp<2>;K2
K4;k2_tree_comp<4>;K4
